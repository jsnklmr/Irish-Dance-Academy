# Irish-Dance-Academy
Fiona's Irish Dance Academy

In this landing page I utilized two media queries. The default is for full size screens.  I used a media query with a max-width of 768px for tablet sized screens which collapsed the nav menu to a hamburger menu.  The hamburger menu has javascript applied to it to allow you to toggle between the hamburger and the nav menu in the smaller screens.  I also used a media query for screens with a max-width of 580px and used inline grid to stack the container for better viewing on phones.  My two CSS components are the hamburger and css grid/flexbox and my one javascript toggles the hamburger menu.  The links are not live to any other pages so no need to click your way through this particular page.  If you do "subscribe" to the newsletter you get the generic thank you page from the pluralsight tutorials.
